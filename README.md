## Project Description
This is a personal project I have decided to undertake as I am branching out my skills as a developer into back-end engineering.  I have been working with data (analysis, modelling, engineering) for 7 years in the financial sector, along with some cloud infrastructure.  More recently, I have been doing a lot of development in Power Platform, doing this brought me to the realisation that back-end engineering really interested me.

I have been completing a [Back-End Engineering](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/back-end-engineer) course from CodeCademy which has been teaching me the following skills:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- API Development
- PostgreSQL
- And more...

Having been looking at projects I could undertake that brings all of these skills together, I came across the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) which has peaked my interest as it encourages you to build it in your own way, but provides some basic guidance with different cloud providers (I personally prefer Azure and it is nice to see that option instead of purely AWS), and a full guide if required.
