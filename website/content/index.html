                    To further my computing knowledge, I attended Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland to complete their Information Systems Delivery honours course.<br>
                    This was a 4 year course at the end of which, I received a Bachelors of Science (BSc) award.<br>
                    During my time on this course, I complete the following courses:
                </p>
            <h3>Year 1</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Year 2</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Year 3</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Year 4</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                During my fourth year of the course, I undertook my dissertation project.  For this, I aimed to assess the viability of mobile applications for education within schools.<br>
                This involved doing a number of samples and wireframe examples of how these applications might work and benefit the teachers and students alike.<br>
                Once the initial analysis phase was complete, the second part of the project was to develop an android application that would work on a mobile device that could be used in schools (this would be very basic just to get some end results).<br>
                The application itself was written in Java within Android Studio.<br>
